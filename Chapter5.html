            <h2>Introduction to Supersonic and Hypersonic Flows</h2>
            <p>Supersonic and hypersonic flows refer to fluid flow regimes where the flow velocity is significantly higher than the speed of sound. These regimes present unique challenges and phenomena that are critical in the fields of aerospace engineering, particularly in the design and analysis of high-speed aircraft, missiles, and space vehicles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supersonic Flow:</strong> Flow with a Mach number (M) greater than 1 but less than 5.</li>
