            <h1>Chapter 7: Aerodynamic Stability and Control</h1>

            <h2>Introduction to Aerodynamic Stability and Control</h2>
            <p>Aerodynamic stability and control are crucial aspects of aerospace engineering that ensure the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. Stability refers to the ability of an aircraft to maintain or return to a desired flight condition after a disturbance, while control refers to the ability of the pilot or automated systems to manage the aircraft's attitude and trajectory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> The tendency of an aircraft to maintain or return to a particular flight condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> The ability to change the aircraft's flight path and attitude.</li>
                <li><strong>Axes of Rotation:</strong> Longitudinal, lateral, and vertical axes.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Surfaces:</strong> Ailerons, elevators, and rudders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Stability</h2>

            <h3>Static Stability</h3>
            <p>Static stability refers to the initial tendency of an aircraft to return to its original flight condition after a small disturbance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive Static Stability:</strong> The aircraft tends to return to its original position.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutral Static Stability:</strong> The aircraft remains in the new position.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Static Stability:</strong> The aircraft continues to move away from its original position.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dynamic Stability</h3>
            <p>Dynamic stability refers to the aircraft's response over time after a disturbance. It includes the aircraft's oscillations and how these oscillations are damped out.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive Dynamic Stability:</strong> Oscillations decrease over time, and the aircraft returns to its original position.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutral Dynamic Stability:</strong> Oscillations remain constant over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Dynamic Stability:</strong> Oscillations increase over time, and the aircraft becomes unstable.</li>
