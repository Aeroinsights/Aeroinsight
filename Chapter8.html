These systems provide the necessary thrust to propel aircraft and spacecraft, enabling them to achieve desired speeds and altitudes. This chapter delves into various advanced propulsion technologies, their principles of operation, and their applications in both atmospheric and space flight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thrust Generation:</strong> The force that propels a vehicle forward.</li>
